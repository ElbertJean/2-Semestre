## 3 – Reading and vocabulary:
<p>I’m a live music promoter. I work for a small company in Sydney. We find new bands and promote them – we sell tickets, print posters, book the venues - things like that.
My typical working day is pretty long. First of all I arrive at the office early – around eight or eight-thirty. Then I check my e-mails. I usually have a lot of messages from bands and booking agencies. Next, I talk to the management team to check the program of events. After that, I usually have meetings. I spend the afternoon meeting clients – sometimes two or three meetings a day. Finally, in the evenings, I watch the bands perform, or I go looking for new acts. I really like my job. It’s very interesting and I meet lots of different people.</p>
